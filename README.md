# Threat Hunt T1059 Report (Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell)

**Detection of Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell**

## Example Scenario:
A mid-sized company, TechCo, was operating within the financial services sector, providing software solutions for clients. The company maintained a robust IT infrastructure with an in-house security team dedicated to monitoring and responding to potential cyber threats. TechCo's security monitoring team noticed unusual activity on the network. An alert triggered from the SIEM system indicated multiple failed login attempts from an internal user account to a sensitive company database. However, the investigation into this event quickly led the security team to a surprising discovery: an employee’s machine was being used to execute suspicious PowerShell scripts that appeared to be obfuscated. The SIEM alert flagged unusual PowerShell activity executed from John’s machine. The PowerShell commands appeared to be obfuscated—seemingly innocent commands that were encoded using base64 and executed via the -EncodedCommand flag.

## High-Level TOR related IoC Discovery Plan:
1. Check DeviceProcessEvents for commands using the -EncodedCommand Flag
2. Check DeviceEvents for any signs of installation or usage 
3. Check AlertEvidence for Antivirus status

## Detection Queries:
```kql
// Installer name == tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-(version).exe
// Detect the installer being downloaded
DeviceFileEvents
| where FileName startswith "tor"

// TOR Browser being silently installed
// Take note of two spaces before the /S (I don't know why)
DeviceProcessEvents
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.0.1.exe  /S"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, ProcessCommandLine

// TOR Browser or service was successfully installed and is present on the disk
DeviceFileEvents
| where FileName has_any ("tor.exe", "firefox.exe")
| project  Timestamp, DeviceName, RequestAccountName, ActionType, InitiatingProcessCommandLine

// TOR Browser or service was launched
DeviceProcessEvents
| where ProcessCommandLine has_any("tor.exe","firefox.exe")
| project  Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ActionType, ProcessCommandLine

// TOR Browser or service is being used and is actively creating network connections
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where InitiatingProcessFileName in~ ("tor.exe", "firefox.exe")
| where RemotePort in (9001, 9030, 9040, 9050, 9051, 9150)
